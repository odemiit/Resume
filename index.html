              <h2>Hello.</h2>
              <p class="intro">I am a recent Computer Science Graduate from The Lassonde School of Engineering at York University. I have a variety of diverse experiences in roles such as 
                  Project Management, Office Administrator, Sales, Social Media management and Supervising. 
                  These experiences have harnessed many of my soft skills such as problem-solving, communication, leadership, and critical thinking.</p>

                <h3>Digital Marketing</h3>
                <p>My interest in marketing peaked when I volunteered as the Marketing and Outreach Lead for Ellehacks, a hackathon females and non - binary. Overtime,
                  I have gained some experience SEO, link building campaigns and managing social media accounts as well as taking the Digital Marketing Certificate by Hubspot Academy.</p>

                <h3>Content Creation</h3>
                <p>I started creating content in 2016 because I loved photography. After years of creating for fun, I started getting recognised and creating content
                  for brands as an ambasaddor and Women in Science and Engineering at York University.

                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>As a creative, design has always been a huge part of my day to day activities. I was able to put these skills to use as the Media Executive for 
                  Women in Science at Engineering for York University. I used software programs and other tools to provide accurate, organized and efficient graphics
                  for several social media platforms as well as the website.
